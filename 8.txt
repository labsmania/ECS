 Step 1
 Launch both VMs and run the ifconfig command to get IPs of both devices.

 Step 2
 Ping VM1 and VM2fromeachother using ping <IP> command from both VMsto confirm connectivity between
 both VMs.

 Step 3
 Install SSH and Python on both terminals using the following commands:
 sudo apt update
 sudo apt install openssh-client
 sudo apt install python3 or sudo apt-get install python3

 Step 4
 Start python server on Metasploitable VM (victim)
 python-m SimpleHTTPServer 8080

Step 5
 Use SSH to connect to victim VM from Kali VM (attacker)
 ssh -L 9090:localhost:8080 msfadmin@<Metasploitable_IP>
 If this does not work use the following command
 ssh -o HostkeyAlgorithms=+ssh-rsa -L 9090:localhost:8080 msfadmin@<Metasploitable_IP>

 Step 6
 In Kali VM, Open the browser and search http://localhost:9090. You can see the content of Metasploitable VM
